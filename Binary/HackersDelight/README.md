# Binary.HackersDelight

This module implements the theorems in the book "Hacker's Delight" by Henry S. Warren Jr. (2nd Edition).

## Proof strategy

To keep the proofs simple, we tend to make base definitions proof friendly, then,
if needed, we show the equivalence between our and theirs definitions.
